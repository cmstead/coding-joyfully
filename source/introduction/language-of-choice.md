    (title "Language In Example Code"))
/bl-->

The language I work in most often is Javascript.  I am using this language in the example code throughout the book, not because I believe it is inherently better than any other language, but because it is the language I write most fluently.  Aside from my personal fluency in a language, it is common for people who write in a variety of different tech stacks to encounter, and have to write, Javascript.

I believe the ideas presented throughout this book will be applicable to most languages programmers are working in today.  Some of the tooling may be better or worse for a given language, but what better reason for you to take up the mantle and make the coding experience more joyful for the people in your community?
