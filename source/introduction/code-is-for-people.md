It is worth noting code is not actually for computers. I know there are people who aregue otherwise, however, it is relatively easy to disprove the notion that code is for computers.  If code were for computers, we would still be working directly in binary or hexadecimal.  Even assembly code is designed to be readable by people rather than computers. The structure of a modern programming language is designed around written human language, and the most popular languages currently are all centered around English.

Even when we look at a programming language as foreign as APL, it was designed, not for typing, but for writing on a chalkboard. This means APL was actually designed specifically with human ergonomics in mind first and foremost.

We can assume, then, that people are intended to both read and write software as a coded document. Write-only software is antithetical to the very nature of the human condition, which leads us to desire communication and the ability to build a mental model of the system we are trying to design and develop.

Mindful software development is founded in the notion that people will undertake software development and design framed around communication, context, and understanding. Instead of simply hacking in a solution and crossing our fingers that everything will work out okay, we will approach software considering the next person who must maintain it. I have seen too many instances of software created with the intent of being a short-term solution, become a large system which the entire business relies on in order to function day to day.  This is the case where mindfulness can be overlooked, generating a tremendous amount of cruft and design anti-structure left in the wake.
