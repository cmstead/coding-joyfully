**Emotion is stored in code as it is written.**

The Kerney-Larsen (abbreviated KL) effect can be observed as people work through code which was written at an earlier time, as opposed to code actively being written now. Since your emotional state is precisely what it is at the moment you are writing code, it is unlikely you can control what emotional information will be captured in the code at first writing.

Since this effect describes the past-tense capture of emotion, the goal is to understand what state the previous programmer was in when the code they wrote was created.  This understanding would, ideally, provide a sense of empathy, which makes it easier to refactor the code without assuming the prior programmer was incapable or hostile.

Refactoring within the context of the KL effect can be viewed as writing, rather than editing, which means new emotions can be captured in the code, and old, potentially negative, emotion will be removed.  This means code which was written in a state of anger, fear, anxiety or confusion, can be retooled to not only capture context, but convey a sense of calm, or even joy.

This book assumes the KL effect will impact your development experience and uses the outcome of captured emotion as a tool to help inform us on how we might move forward with better understanding and a richer context than we had going in.
