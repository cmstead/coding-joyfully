Through the course of this book, we will explore several different ideas around building software and the kinds of work which can be done to make the coding experience mindful.  Through this mindfulness, hopefully coding will become a joyful activity which can be pursued both at work and, if you are so inclined, at home.

#### Context Building ####

Building context and understanding what the aim is of any line, object, or module is critical to building software which works and can be maintained over time. This context can either be centered around development patterns or around a business domain.

In this section we will explore how tests can be used to define and develop context. Tests are not required to be written perfectly the first time, instead they should reflect the constantly changing nature of the context from which our code is emerging.

Types can be used, not only to ensure continuity in use for behaviors, but also to provide visual context around the domain language and associated values the previous developer intended to use.  When types and evolved tests are used in concert context becomes clear quickly.

Finally, we will look at refactoring and how it can be used to capture context in our code as well as in our tests. It is quite common for automated tests to be written in the same language as our production code, which means any tools we use to manage our code will be equally useful for managing the code defining our tests.
