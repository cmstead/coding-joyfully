Throughout the course of my career I have had many epiphanies. Typically these opportunities come on the heels of changing the way I approach a problem. The biggest challenge I had to overcome was how I could change the way I work or learn in order to trigger the next epiphany.  This book is the best distillation I could compile at this point on what triggers learning and understanding for me and others I have worked with.

One idea I have played with recently is liminal space. Without doing a deep dive, liminal space is a place between "what was" and "what is next." This liminal space, as applied to software, is a current idea on how to trigger new discoveries in thought, learning and problem solving. Effectively, if a developer is constantly pushing against the boundaries of what they know, they are more likely to uncover something they didn't know before.

All of the ideas in this book are intended to either free the developer from mental clutter, or provide ways in which to push the boundaries of their thinking in order to generate mental liminal space where seeds of discovery may be planted. With this in mind, this book will not provide a "single true way" to ascend to the the heights of the greatest programming minds. Instead consider this book as an exploration of ways to change perspective around code to facilitate learning and greater insight.
