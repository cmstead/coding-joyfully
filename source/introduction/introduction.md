At the point in my career where I began work on this book, I have been writing software for more than 20 years. In the time since I started my software journey, lots of technical books have been written about the concepts of clean code, refactoring, patterns, pragmatic practices, and so on. As can happen with any career, I have experienced my share of ups and downs.  I have enjoyed jobs only to have my experience sour.  I've worked in languages and then found myself driven away from the community for one reason or another.

Through all of this experience, I have considered myself a passionate programmer. I enjoy solving problems and I often go on a search for new things people might need to make their job easier. This particular search led me down the path of creating open source tools.

Many software developers I have met started their journey because they played video games and wanted to create them.  This couldn't have been further from my story.  In high school I was a passionate musician.  I played multiple instruments -- some with more skill than others -- and I wanted to share my love of music with the world. I was fortunate that the, now long defunct, Geocities was there for just such a budding enthusiast such as myself.

Since I never had the desire to write video games, my desire to write software was always centered around creating something useful, or at the very least, better than what I already had. This ultimately paved the way to creating tools I could share with the community.  I found the tools I created to be most interesting to others when I was scratching an itch I already had.

At this point, I center much of my open source development effort around creating tools which make software creation more joyful. Although the notion of joyful creation had resonance for me, other people didn't seem to quite understand what I valued and why it brought me joy.

Through trial and error, I discovered that what seemed to bring me the most joy while creating anything, software related or not, was the mindfulness that arose through a sense of understanding what I am doing and where my work is leading me.

This book aims to explore the way I approach what I consider "mindful software development" and how what the facets are which make mindful software development possible.

It is worth emphasizing now, this book is not intended to argue that my approach is the "one true way," or any such silliness.  Instead I hope you come away with a sense of how each of the ideas I present works toward making software development a mindful, joyful experience.
