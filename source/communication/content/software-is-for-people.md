/bl-->

One of the most important aspects of any software project is that software is always intended for use by people.  This does not mean the general public is going to directly consume a print driver directly from a terminal session. It does mean someone, somewhere, is going to have to actually use the thing you wrote. Even more likely, the person who will end up using it is you.

In my day job, I work in application development, so everything I write either directly, or indirectly, impacts a customer somewhere in the world.  When I write tools for developers, I aim to make the development experience better for at least one person, often me.

Understanding our work impacts people means we must, at least at some level, communicate with the people who interact with what we create. We might send an error message, or we might actually create a full user experience.  Sometimes the communication is a document on the web and sometimes, as is often the case in what I write, the communication comes from a test suite.

Before launching into the nuts and bolts of mindful software development, let's explore the idea of how communication works in the code we write every day.
