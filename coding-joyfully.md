## Introduction ##

At the point in my career where I began work on this book, I have been writing software for more than 20 years. In the time since I started my software journey, lots of technical books have been written about the concepts of clean code, refactoring, patterns, pragmatic practices, and so on. As can happen with any career, I have experienced my share of ups and downs.  I have enjoyed jobs only to have my experience sour.  I've worked in languages and then found myself driven away from the community for one reason or another.

Through all of this experience, I have considered myself a passionate programmer. I enjoy solving problems and I often go on a search for new things people might need to make their job easier. This particular search led me down the path of creating open source tools.

Many software developers I have met started their journey because they played video games and wanted to create them.  This couldn't have been further from my story.  In high school I was a passionate musician.  I played multiple instruments -- some with more skill than others -- and I wanted to share my love of music with the world. I was fortunate that the, now long defunct, Geocities was there for just such a budding enthusiast such as myself.

Since I never had the desire to write video games, my desire to write software was always centered around creating something useful, or at the very least, better than what I already had. This ultimately paved the way to creating tools I could share with the community.  I found the tools I created to be most interesting to others when I was scratching an itch I already had.

At this point, I center much of my open source development effort around creating tools which make software creation more joyful. Although the notion of joyful creation had resonance for me, other people didn't seem to quite understand what I valued and why it brought me joy.

Through trial and error, I discovered that what seemed to bring me the most joy while creating anything, software related or not, was the mindfulness that arose through a sense of understanding what I am doing and where my work is leading me.

This book aims to explore the way I approach what I consider "mindful software development" and how what the facets are which make mindful software development possible.

It is worth emphasizing now, this book is not intended to argue that my approach is the "one true way," or any such silliness.  Instead I hope you come away with a sense of how each of the ideas I present works toward making software development a mindful, joyful experience.


### Language In Example Code ###

The language I work in most often is Javascript.  I am using this language in the example code throughout the book, not because I believe it is inherently better than any other language, but because it is the language I write most fluently.  Aside from my personal fluency in a language, it is common for people who write in a variety of different tech stacks to encounter, and have to write, Javascript.

I believe the ideas presented throughout this book will be applicable to most languages programmers are working in today.  Some of the tooling may be better or worse for a given language, but what better reason for you to take up the mantle and make the coding experience more joyful for the people in your community?
    
    

## Communication ##


### Software is for People ###

One of the most important aspects of any software project is that software is always intended for use by people.  This does not mean the general public is going to directly consume a print driver directly from a terminal session. It does mean someone, somewhere, is going to have to actually use the thing you wrote. Even more likely, the person who will end up using it is you.

In my day job, I work in application development, so everything I write either directly, or indirectly, impacts a customer somewhere in the world.  When I write tools for developers, I aim to make the development experience better for at least one person, often me.

Understanding our work impacts people means we must, at least at some level, communicate with the people who interact with what we create. We might send an error message, or we might actually create a full user experience.  Sometimes the communication is a document on the web and sometimes, as is often the case in what I write, the communication comes from a test suite.

Before launching into the nuts and bolts of mindful software development, let's explore the idea of how communication works in the code we write every day.
    

### Testing ###

There seems to be a never-ending debate about the value of automated tests, whether they provide value and when they should be written.  I will explore how to write tests which communicate later, but for the moment, let's explore the real value we gain from writing tests, communication.

An automated test suite provides two distinct kinds of value for the programmer: feedback when something breaks or changes, and information on how to consume the API under test.
